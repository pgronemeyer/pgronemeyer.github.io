  As a field ecologist for many years, I was privileged to work in many beautiful places, and witness many amazing plants, animals, and ecosystems. (Check out my <a id="piclink" href="CoolPicts.html"> Cool picts...."</a> )​<br>​<br>However, at some point, (and as I got older...) I decided I wanted to do more than simply collect field data; I wanted to be more involved in the data analysis and actual research.  While I did not think field observations and data collection could ever be replaced by technology, I did ​believe that GIS and remote sensing could compliment field work, and were largely untapped resources for field data collection. So I added GIS, GPS, programming, and remote sensing to my skills in the hope that I could improve the ease, efficiency, and quality of field data collection and analysis. In the process I was fortunate enough to go to out-of-this-workd incredible, gorgeous Botswana to study African wild dogs, and saw more than ever how GIS and remote sensing were needed to 'see' where these wide-ranging and incredibly amazing animals were spending their time. <br>​<br>​​​More recently I have added web page development and design (in the form of html and css), to my skillset in order to reach more people as the internet continues to link people from all countries and cultures.<br>​ <br>​​My other interests are skydiving and the rescue and rehabilitation of dogs and cats.  I have fostered many a sweet dog, cried when they were adopted, and had only one 'foster failure’, managing to limit myself to (currently) two wonderful dogs as my companions and best friends, who make me smile and laugh every day.  <br>​<br>​​With those things in mind, I would like to encourage you to check out a non-profit called Working dogs for Conservation, (http://wd4c.org/).  This is an organization which adopts dogs from shelters and trains them to do conservation work.  It's a fantastic organization, combining dog rescue with conservation.  What could be better?
